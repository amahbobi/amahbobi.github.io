    <h1>How to Become a Better Runner</h1>
    <p>Becoming a better runner, or a runner at all, <b>is easy.</b> The main thing that people get wrong 
       is that they run too fast and have this expectation that they need to be running for extremely long periods
        of time in order to get better. This is far from the truth. Instead, the main way to improve your running distance 
        and stamina is to run <b>slowly!</b> Start with half a mile or one mile, and just focus on building a running habit
        before signing up for a marathon or stressing about speed runs. Take it slow, build a solid aerobic foundation, and then 
        once it gets easy you can start adding time or distance to your runs.  </p>
